This repo is a Jekyll website, with source code embedded using
[working markup](http://lalashan.mcmaster.ca/theobio/projects/index.php/Working_Markup),
for development relating to automated processing of compartment models.

It includes [a Sage implementation of compartment models](BoxModelsInSage.html)
built on [an external Sage package for dynamical systems](https://github.com/worden-lee/SageDynamics).

It also includes tests and development related to
[the separate R package for compartment models](https://github.com/tcporco/boxmodel)
(which is written largely in Common Lisp).
