This repository is a package for the Sage computer math system,
in the form of a Python module.
This module provides an implementation of the compartmental model
(or "box model")
convention used in epidemiology, pharmacology and other disciplines,
and a product framework for constructing compartmental models
by combining simpler compartmental models.

To install, cd to this project's directory and type

`$ make install`

or, if necessary,

`$ sudo make install`

depending on how your Sage installation is set up.

It requires
[an additional Sage package for dynamical systems](https://github.com/worden-lee/SageDynamics)
as a prerequisite, which must also be installed.
